# SeismicViewer

This is legacy C++ source code package created at READ Well Services as GUI part of in-house processing system SPRINT. The code is written with Qt4, wrapping around CanacSeismic library of INT. 

The features of underlying INT CanacSeismic library (no source code) is quite limited and bound to Qt4, so it works only on old linux system.
